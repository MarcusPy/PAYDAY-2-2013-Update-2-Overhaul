### Installation:
  1. **Downloading update 2**
      - Made for the fixed update 2 from 2013 (manifest id 6534432302280289873).
      - Obtain the said version of the game using DepotDownloader (https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader)
      - You don't need to put the files in the Steam's PD2 directory, you can simply create another folder and drop steam_appid.txt there, this will allows you to run the game using its exe and still be able to use Steam
      - If you want to allow PD2 to access 4GB of RAM rather than just 2, you can check out this (https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371)
  2. **Installing the mods**
      - Drop IPHLPAPI.dll and the mods folder in the main directory
      - Install the mods located within 'required mods' folder
      - You may also install the 'optional mods'
      - Download the original BundleModder (https://modworkshop.net/mod/197)
      - Install the mods from 'required pdmods' using this tool
      - You may also install 'optional pdmods'
  3. **Creating a backup (optional)**
      - Navigate to C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Local
      - Rename, copy or zip the PAYDAY 2 folder
      - While using the Overhaul won't overwrite your save file, because we occupy a different slot, your renderer_settings.xml will be overwritten
